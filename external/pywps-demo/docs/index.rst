PyWPS-Flask documentation
########################

PyWPS-Flask is a little project, which shall be distributed along with `PyWPS
<http://pywps.org>`_ project. This is just an example service based on PyWPS, with
several example processes. We are adding also a sample `demo.py` which can be used
with the `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ microframework.
